# BRWebplayer
 
This project is something simple to enable easier streaming of downloaded videos.
Oftentimes on discord, when I watch movies that are downloaded (when they aren't available on the major OTTs), the server doesn't allow sharing of audio unless it's from a browser. 
My project's primary goal is to play a local MP4 file on a browser, so that I can enjoy streaming movies on discord without any hitches.
